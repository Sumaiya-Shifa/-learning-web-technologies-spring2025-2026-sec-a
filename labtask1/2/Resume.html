    <p>
        I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate with
        experience in programming and object-oriented software
        development. I have completed several academic projects using
        C# and Java that strengthened my understanding of OOP and
        OOP-II concepts, and I also have practical knowledge of
        C++, Python, Java, and HTML. I am interested in IoT-based 
        systems and emerging technologies and am seeking opportunities
        to improve my technical skills and establish myself as a capable 
        software engineer.
